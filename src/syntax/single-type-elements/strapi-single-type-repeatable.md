# strapi-single-type-repeatable

The `strapi-single-type-repeatable` attribute works much the same as the [strapi-repeatable](../relations-and-repeatables/strapi-repeatable.md) attribute, but can be used for repeatable single types.  It also does not need to exist as a child of a template element, unlike the `strapi-repeatable` attribute.
