# EZForms

Strapify integrates with the Strapi EZForms plugin to allow you to easily connect your HTML forms to your Strapi backend.  Simply add the `strapi-ezforms-form` and `strapi-ezforms-submit` to the submit button of that form and you're ready to go!

Note that the <a href="https://market.strapi.io/plugins/strapi-plugin-ezforms" target="_blank">EZForms Plugin</a> needs to be installed and configured on your Strapi backend for this to work.  EZForms does not include file uploads, so if you need to upload files, you may want to use a different method.
