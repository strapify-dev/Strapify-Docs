# strapi-sort

The `strapi-sort` attribute is used to specify a sort order for the populated template elements in a collection, relation or repeatable element. When multiple arguments are given, the sort is done in the order that the arguments appear.

Strapify will reflect changes to this attribute automatically if it is changed with a script.

The `strapi-sort-control` attribute can be used on buttons to control the behavior of the strapi-sort attribute when clicked.
