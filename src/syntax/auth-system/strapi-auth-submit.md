# strapi-auth-submit

The `strapi-auth-submit`attribute should be used in `strapi-auth` forms to indicate the submit button. When clicked, it triggers the authentication process (either registration or login). The attribute is typically added to a `<button>` element of type "submit".

If `strapi-auth` is set to `register`, the form will attempt to create a new user from the credentials provided in the form inputs using `strapi-auth-input`.

If `strapi-auth` is set to `authenticate`, it will attempt to authenticate the user based on the credentials provided in the login form, and the userâ€™s JWT token will be stored in localStorage.
