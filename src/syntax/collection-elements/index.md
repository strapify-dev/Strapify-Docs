# Collection Elements

_Collection elements_ are HTML elements that contain [template elements](../../syntax/template-elements/index.md). These elements correspond to a Strapi collection. These elements will contain all the populated template elements after Strapify executes. These elements are defined with the `strapi-collection` attribute. 

Collection elements *can* exist inside other collection elements, but not as the children of their template elements.
